# CIS554-anglicize

A small python program that takes a 7 digit number and returns the anglicized written number. 

Example:

`1` returns 'one'

`111` returns 'one hundred eleven'

`253180` returns 'two hundred fifty thousand one hundred eighty'

Part of eCornell's python certificate program, it was an example program used for explanatory purporses. Recreating just for fun.
